# Active Claude sessions — coordination scoreboard

**READ THIS BEFORE EDITING ANY FILE.** Multiple Claude sessions can
run concurrently in this workspace (context auto-fork on >50% usage,
or the user may launch parallel sessions intentionally). Without
coordination, parallel sessions clobber each other's writes.

The rule: **read this file first. Claim the files you'll touch.
Release on exit.** Other sessions defer to active claims.

---

## Active claims

<!--
Format for each claim — start a new ### block per session, never edit
someone else's:

### Session <short-id> · started <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> · heartbeat <HH:MM>
- **Scope**: one-line description of what this session is doing
- **Files / globs**: paths this session may write to
- **Branch**: git branch this session is on
- **Working dir**: absolute path (different from default if using a worktree)

Update your own heartbeat every ~20 turns. If your heartbeat is older
than 60 minutes, other sessions may consider your claim stale.
-->

### Session 2026-06-11-consolidation-tenant-scope · started 2026-06-11 · heartbeat (start)
- **Scope**: Tenant-scope the consolidation report's account-metadata + root-entity lookups (cross-tenant subtype/isContra bleed into IC elimination) + regression tests
- **Files / globs**: `src/lib/accounting/reports/consolidation.ts`, `src/app/reports/consolidation/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/reports/consolidation/csv/route.ts`, `tests/consolidation.test.ts`, `tests/tenant-isolation.test.ts`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `STATUS.md`
- **Branch**: `fix/consolidation-tenant-scoped-lookups`
- **Working dir**: /Users/hosungson/Code/ledger-core

## Recent completions

<!--
When a session finishes work, move its block here with a final timestamp.
Keep the last ~10 entries; trim older ones to keep this file under 200 lines.

Example:

### Session <short-id> · YYYY-MM-DD (commit `<sha7>`)
- **Scope**: what shipped
- **Branch**: branch name (and whether merged/pushed)
- **Outcome**: one-line result
-->

### Session 2026-06-08-evening · 2026-06-09 (PRs #180-#200)
- **Scope**: v0.9 NS SuiteAnalytics Arc 6 burndown (5 PRs) + Arc 7 adversarial pass (CWE-1236 CSV injection) + Arc 8 v1.2+ polish closure (Tab shortcut, sortable aging, HISTORICAL ASC 830 pin, orphan-tenant cleanup) + RLS arc Decision C ack on PR #89 + 3 CI infrastructure fixes (npm-audit threshold + test workflow pnpm→npm + gitleaks binary install) + this orchestrator install
- **Branch**: 21 individual PR branches off main; `install-orchestrator-protocol` is the last
- **Outcome**: 21 PRs shipped on ledger-core (#180-#200) plus 4 companion-repo CLAUDE.md mirrors (recon #28-#29, revenue-rec #32-#33, fa-amort #25-#26, integrations #22-#23). v0.9 NS arc fully closed (Phases 1-5 + SuiteAnalytics + Burndown + 34th adversarial pass). v1.2+ ergonomics-and-polish list fully cleared. 3 CI blockers fixed (RLS arc unblocks once #197-#199 merge). Tomorrow's session inherits the protocol and the 27-PR RLS arc merge queue.

## How to use this file

**At session start (every session, every time):**
1. Read this file
2. Look at active claims
3. If your task overlaps with an active claim, either:
   - Pick a different task
   - Wait for the other session to finish
   - Surface the conflict to the user before proceeding

**Before your first file edit:**
4. Append a `### Session <id>` block under "Active claims" with your
   scope + the files/globs you'll touch + your branch + working dir
5. Commit STATUS.md immediately (small atomic commit) so other
   sessions see your claim — uncommitted claims race with concurrent
   reads

**Every ~20 turns:**
6. Update your heartbeat timestamp in STATUS.md (also small atomic
   commit)

**At session end:**
7. Move your block to "Recent completions" with a final outcome line
8. Commit one last time

**If you see a stale claim** (heartbeat >60 min old):
- The owning session may have died; gently take over but log it
- Add a `~~strikethrough~~ stale per <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` note in
  their block

**Forbidden:**
- Editing another session's claim block (only the owner edits it)
- Skipping the read step
- Holding a claim on the entire repo (`**`) — break work into scoped
  chunks

## Why this works

The protocol is **soft + advisory**, not a hard lock. It works because:

1. **Visibility** — every session sees what every other session is
   doing
2. **Atomic small commits** — claims race-loose-but-don't-collide
   because git serializes commits. If two sessions try to claim at
   once, one's `git pull` shows the other's claim before the second
   writes
3. **Human arbitration** — when sessions DO collide, the user (one
   person driving N sessions) sees the conflict in the commit log
   and can manually coordinate
4. **Cheap** — no daemons, no Redis, no extra processes. Just a file
   + discipline encoded in CLAUDE.md

Hard locks (e.g. lockfile + fcntl) would be more robust but require
infrastructure. For ~5 self-reporting Claude sessions with one human
overseer, soft coordination is enough.
